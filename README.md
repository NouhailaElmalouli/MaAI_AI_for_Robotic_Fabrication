**IDEAS (BRAINSTORMING)**

1. trasnforming a physiscal object into a dynamic 3d geometry through the use of sensing tools.

2. using ml approaches to make autonomous drones that allows them to detect and avoid obstacles.

3. use ai to control the coordination of robots: <br>
    3.1 use swarms to move objects. <br>
    3.2 use swarm to get from point a to point b using coordinaton between the robot caabilities. <br>
    3.3 use swarms to get robots to coordinate and build something architectural. <br>

4. translating flat drawings into drawings in not planar surfaces.
