**PROJECT MEMBERS:**

- Ramy Anka <br>
- Salvador Cantuarias <br>
- Nouhaila Elmalouli <br>
- Misra Ozgok <br>
- Elena Papakosta <br>

**IDEAS (BRAINSTORMING)**

1. trasnforming a physiscal object into a dynamic 3d geometry through the use of sensing tools.

2. using ml approaches to make autonomous drones that allows them to detect and avoid obstacles. **(denied)**

3. use ai to control the coordination of robots: <br>
    3.1 use swarms to move objects. <br>
    3.2 use swarm to get from point a to point b using coordinaton between the robot capabilities. **(denied)** <br> 
    3.3 use swarms to get robots to coordinate and build something architectural. **(accepted)** project iaac 'minibuilders' <br> 

4. translating flat drawings into drawings in not planar surfaces. **(accepted)**


# IDEAS

1. OPTIMIZING THE MOVEMENT OF A ROBOTIC ARM BY USING GENETIC ALGORITHMS

2. OPTIMISING THE TOOLPATH AF  ROBOTIC ARM BY USING AGENTS

3. USING LLMS AND VLMS TO MAKE A ROBOT UNDERSTAND HUMAN VOICE AND BODY COMMANDS.
