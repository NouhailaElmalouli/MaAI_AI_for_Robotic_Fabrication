**WHAT?**
üîç We aim to develop a regression model that predicts the 6-joint configurations (joint coordination) of an ABB robotic arm during 3D clay printing, based on simulated toolpath data and actual printed movement data.

**WHY?**
üéØ To identify and learn the discrepancies between simulated and real joint movements, enabling more accurate motion planning, error correction, and improved robotic fabrication outcomes.

**HOW?**
üõ†Ô∏è By collecting and preprocessing joint angle data from Rhino-modeled toolpaths, RoboStudio simulations, and post-printing movements, we train a regression model through polynomial or linear regression to predict joint values for given toolpath positions, enabling us to analyze, anticipate and prospectively refine robotic motion.





1. trasnforming a physiscal object into a dynamic 3d geometry through the use of sensing tools.

2. using ml approaches to make autonomous drones that allows them to detect and avoid obstacles. **(denied)**

3. use ai to control the coordination of robots: <br>
    3.1 use swarms to move objects. <br>
    3.2 use swarm to get from point a to point b using coordinaton between the robot capabilities. **(denied)** <br> 
    3.3 use swarms to get robots to coordinate and build something architectural. **(accepted)** project iaac 'minibuilders' <br> 

4. translating flat drawings into drawings in not planar surfaces. **(accepted)**


# IDEAS

1. OPTIMIZING THE MOVEMENT OF A ROBOTIC ARM BY USING GENETIC ALGORITHMS

2. OPTIMISING THE TOOLPATH AF  ROBOTIC ARM BY USING AGENTS

3. USING LLMS AND VLMS TO MAKE A ROBOT UNDERSTAND HUMAN VOICE AND BODY COMMANDS.


# Proposal:

**What?:**

**How?:**
1. using multivariable polinomial regression.
